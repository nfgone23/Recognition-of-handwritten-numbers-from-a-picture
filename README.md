## Used Libraries
[Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) - is library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

[Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.git) - is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

[Opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git) - is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision.

## Database
[EMNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/emnist) - The EMNIST dataset is a set of handwritten character digits derived from the NIST Special Database 19 and converted to a 28x28 pixel image format and dataset structure that directly matches the MNIST dataset.

[MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist) - The MNIST database of handwritten digits.
